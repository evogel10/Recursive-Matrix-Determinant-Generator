The source code in this assignment can be compiled from the command line in the Terminal.

To compile the program, locate the directory where the files are in and enter: javac DeterminantGenerator.java MatrixReader.java Determinant.java

To run the program, locate the directory where the complied files are in and enter: java DeterminantGenerator

You will be promoted for an input file name. You may use whatever file you wish, but the one that will be with the project will be called Lab2_Input.txt. If you wish to use this input file with its pre-populated contents enter: Input.txt

You will then be promoted for an output file. Again you may use whatever file you wish. Once you enter the name of the file you wish to create, a new file will appear in the directory containing the order, the matrix itself, and the determinant of matrix or matrices in the input file.
